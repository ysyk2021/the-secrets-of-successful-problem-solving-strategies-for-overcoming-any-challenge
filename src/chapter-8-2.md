**3. Utilize Structured Problem-Solving Methods**
-------------------------------------------------

Structured problem-solving methods provide a systematic approach to finding solutions. Consider these techniques:

* Break down the problem into smaller, manageable components.
* Utilize frameworks such as the "5 Whys" or fishbone diagrams to identify root causes.
* Apply analytical techniques like SWOT analysis or decision trees to evaluate options.
* Implement design thinking or brainstorming techniques to generate innovative solutions.
* Use flowcharts or process maps to visualize and understand complex workflows.
